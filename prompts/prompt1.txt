Create a web scraping and content migration system with the following specifications:

1. SCRAPING REQUIREMENTS
- Target: Static website with JavaScript-rendered content (~200 articles, 1000-3000 words each)
- Content types: Articles, FAQs, Product Listing Pages (3), forms, images, short videos
- Structure: Maintain hierarchical structure and breadcrumb trails
- Special focus: Capture conversion form and persistent CTA banner
- Scale: ~200 articles, must be robust but no massive scaling needed

2. TECHNICAL STACK
- Scraping: Playwright (Python)
  - Handle JavaScript-rendered content
  - Support for modern web features
  - Spider/crawler functionality
  - Minimal respect for robots.txt
  - No rate limiting concerns
  
- Database: 
  - Primary: Elasticsearch (later OpenSearch)
    - Optimized for content search
    - Support hierarchical data structure
    - Enable both syntactic and semantic search
  - Secondary: PostgreSQL
    - Store metadata, logs, user data
    - Track scraping history

- API: FastAPI
  - Simple REST endpoints
  - Basic bearer authentication (2-3 users)
  - Endpoints for content retrieval and search
  - Integration with Elasticsearch/PostgreSQL

3. CONTENT STRUCTURE
- Document schema should include:
  - Unique identifiers
  - Content type (article/FAQ/product)
  - Full text content
  - Media references
  - Hierarchical metadata
  - Breadcrumb information
  - URLs and relationships
  - Timestamps

4. CONTENTFUL INTEGRATION
- One-time migration strategy
- Create matching content models
- Handle media asset upload
- Maintain content relationships
- Support potential re-migration

5. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
1. Set up scraping infrastructure with Playwright
2. Implement content extraction and structure
3. Setup Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL schemas
4. Create FastAPI endpoints
5. Develop ContentFul upload functionality

6. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
- Error handling for failed scrapes
- Data validation before ContentFul upload
- Media asset processing pipeline
- Basic logging and monitoring
- Simple retry mechanisms

Please provide implementation starting with the scraping infrastructure.
